# Class Timelog Description
This is a log of how many hours I have spent on classwork during Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. I wanted to see if I was actually spending the recommended
amount of time on schoolwork (according to my professors at Smith College).

## Fall 2021
I decided to track hours spent in class in additon to hours spent on work outside of class.

## Spring 2022
For this semester I decided to only track classwork completed outside of class, for the sake of simplicity.
